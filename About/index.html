    <p><i>Welcome to Wabi-Style, a unique ceramics gallery and store in one.  
    <p> </p>
      Wabi-Style is the place where our dreams - to share with you the unique beauty of handmade ceramics by the Masters – come true.  
    <p> </p>
      The Japanese word "wabi” reflects our fascination with Japanese aesthetics - its simplicity, love of detail and understated elegance which contribute to unique and exceptional character of every thing, every person and each moment of  life.
    <p> </p>
      We have made  Wabi-Style a place where the Eastern philosophy meets the interpretation of the masters of ceramics from the West. Ceramists from Europe cooperating with us back to the teachings of the Japanese masters, as they care about details. They do it with the same focus and attention and put their soul and beauty of the moment into every piece of ceramics.
    <p> </p>
      From 2011 we have traveled the Europe searching for the ceramic artists – craftsmen - whose works reflect both wabi aesthetics as well as individual, masterful style. At Wabi-Style their works are combined with carefully selected  original Japanese pieces of ceramics imported specially for us - straight from the Land of the Rising Sun.
    <p> </p>
      Pottery and porcelain that can be found at Wabi-Style store, has been filled with echoes of ceramics Masters passion – they are unique, unusual and ready to bring into your home its own soul, individual style - <b>Wabi-Style</b>.</p>
